			I'm a software developer and Computer Science student at the University of Porto.
		</p>
		<p>
			I like to think and work on applications that solve someone's problem, even if mundane. I draw inspiration from using products and thinking about how they could be improved. I'm interested in system design, data modelling and providing intuitive user experiences.

		<p>Currently learning more about cybersecurity, with a particular interest in penetration testing.</p>
		<p>Prior to software development, I was a technical recruiter at Prismic with a background in Social Psychology.</p>
		<p>Will nerd out on basketball and downtempo music.</p>
