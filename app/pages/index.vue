			I'm a software developer living in Porto, Portugal. I also study Computer Science at the University of Porto.
		</p>
		<p>
			I work on web apps that solve someone's problem, wrapped with an intutive user experience. In the process, I enjoy learning about tradeoff decisions, data modelling, and the role of abstractions.
		</p>
		<p>I want to learn more about security driven development. I'm particularly curious about penetration testing.</p>
		<p>I have a background in Social Psychology, and I was a technical recruiter at Prismic. I'm a basketball aficionado.</p>
