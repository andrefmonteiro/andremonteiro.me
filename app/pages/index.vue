			I'm a software developer living in Porto, Portugal. I also study Computer Science at the University of Porto.
		</p>
		<p>
			I like to work on applications that solve someone's problem, even if mundane, and wrap them in an intuitive user experience. I draw inspiration from using products and thinking about how they could be improved. In the process, I enjoy learning about system design tradeoffs and data modelling.
		</p>
		<p>I want to learn more about security-driven development, and I'm particularly curious about penetration testing.</p>
		<p>I also have a background in Social Psychology, and I was a technical recruiter at Prismic. I'm a basketball aficionado.</p>
